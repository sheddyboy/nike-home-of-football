            <b>WHAT ARE THE TRIALS?</b>
            <span>
              The Trials are skills-based challenges based on the characteristic
              features ofeach of the three styles of NIKE footware: Mercurial
              (speed), Phantom (precision) and Tiempo (touch), which  will be
              held throughout the Event for which Prizes are available to be won
              on a daily and weekly basis. Each day, the top three (3)
              Participants who obtain the highest score (“Daily Winners”) on 
              each Trial will obtain a prize (“Daily Prize”); and each week,
              only one (1) Participant with the highest score throughout the
              week (“Weekly Winners”) on each Trial will obtain another prize 
              (“Weekly Prize”). Once all the Prizes have been awarded, the
              Trials will remain open, but no further Prizes shall be available
              to be won. NIKE’s brand ambassadors (“Brand Ambassadors”) will be
              on hand to help administer the Trials and to give out the Prizes.

              the poles, hit the button, dribble back at a sprint and score a

              cone and has five balls to get the highest score possible by
              shooting into the hoop or at the two low targets. The Brand
              Ambassador will supply the Participant with balls from the pink
              basket. The option will be to move the cone starting point to
              facilitate the different skills and levels/ages of Participants.

              as they can, within a marked zone. Participants will receive bonus
              points for any tricks they are able to fit in within the
              designated time. As soon as the ball hits the floor, the
              Participants’ time is over.
